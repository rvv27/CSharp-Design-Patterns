# CSharp-Design-Patterns
All Major Design patterns, each with distinct VS project combined in a single solution. Design patterns are important for writing efficient code in less time with less bugs.

# Important Points
- This repo is derived and converted from @iluwatar 's repository: https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns
- Useful if you are less familiar with Java Syntax and prefer C#.
- Iluwatar's repo contains lot more design patterns which are updated on Regular basis. I would try to port as many design patterns as possible.
- Contributions are welcome.
- Each design pattern is included in a single project in the main solution. You require Visual Studio with Desktop programming package to run the solution. 

# Careful
- Don't force any design patterns in your code. They are intended to simplify your code not make it complex.
- Ideal approach is to learn a design pattern, practice it with writing one or two usecases so it sticks in your mind. Next time whenever you are writing code if the design pattern fits, it would automatically come to your mind.
- Always remember, KEEP IT SIMPLE.
